**The missing MetaMorph handbook** |trade|

Welcome to DocuMorph! This resource allows research core facility
managers of Molecular Devices' *MetaMorph* software to instruct both,
new and savvy users, in making the most of their complex imaging
microscopes.

This reference aspires to be the "missing handbook" replacing
handwritten lab notes and vendor e-mail exchange threads.  Scientists
using the software are encouraged to submit existing reference
material for inclusion, make suggestions, and also to directly edit
this handbook.
