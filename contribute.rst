Development
***********

In keeping with the open process, this project's GitHub `issue`_
tracker is the primary communication medium for enhancing content.

The full websource is available on `GitHub`_.  Best practise would be to
fork the project on GitHub, test your changes with Sphinx, and then
create a pull request.  Although this requires knowing/learning a
little about git, python and reStructuredText, it is well worth
getting familiar with these tools.
 

Adding Content
--------------

The easiest way to contribute would be sending files containing your
instructional material (.odt, .doc) containing images (.png), and
associated journals (.jzp, .jnl).  In keeping with the open nature of
this project, |raise_issue|


Requests and Fixes
------------------

As above, |raise_issue|
