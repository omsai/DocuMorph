Development
===========

In keeping with the open process, this project's GitHub issue tracker
is the primary communication medium for enhancing content.

The full websource is available on GitHub.  Best practise would be to
fork the project on GitHub, test your changes with Sphinx, and then
create a pull request.  Although this requires knowing/learning a
little about git, python and reStructuredText, it is well worth
getting familiar with these tools.
 

Adding Content
--------------

The easiest way to contribute would be sending files containing your
instructional material (.odt, .doc) containing images (.png), and
associated journals (.jzp, .jnl).  In keeping with the open nature of
this project, raise a new issue in GitHub, otherwise send an e-mail to
omsai@member.fsf.org


Requests and Fixes
------------------

As above, raise a new issue in GitHub or send an e-mail to
omsai@member.fsf.org
